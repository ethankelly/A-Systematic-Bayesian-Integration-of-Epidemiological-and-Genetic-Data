# Bayesian-Integration-of-Epidemiological-and-Genetic-Data
Data and C++ scripts for the paper "A Systematic Bayesian Integration of Epidemiological and Genetic Data (PLos Comp Biology, 2015)"

Read the comments at the beginning of phylo_seir_fmd_inference.cpp first; the header .h file is also useful for understanding the code/function structures.

Welcomed to use/modify the code as long as the paper is properly cited.
